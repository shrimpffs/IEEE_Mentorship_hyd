#### here i am going to document all learning activities done during the internship in the month of july 2024

#### in this month we are focusing on the following things
<ol>
  <li>learning verilog HDL</li>
  <li>learning simulation using intel's modelsim</li>
</ol>

#### the following are the commands to use for the simulation in the cmd mode(we can use GUI mode as well)

1. For creating the work library use the following command <br>
   vlib work
2. for compiling the verilog files use the following command <br>
   vlog file1.v file2.v ... fileN.v
3. For simulation of the design use the following command <br>
   vsim-c topmodule name(it will be module name of the testbench)
4. For running the simulation use the following command <br>
   run-all
5. To come out of the simulation use the following command <br>
   exit
